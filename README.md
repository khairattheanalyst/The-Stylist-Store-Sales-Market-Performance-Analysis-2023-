INTRODUCTION

Shopping isn’t just about what people buy. It's about when, why, and how they choose to do it. This analysis takes a closer look into the customers’ behavior at The Stylist Store, uncovering patterns and insights hidden in everyday purchases. From favorite seasons to shipping choices, I analyzed these trends using Microsoft Excel and its features to turn numbers into data-driven insights that helps the business understand its customers better and make smarter decisions. 

 

STORY OF THE DATA

This data tells the story of how individual customers interact with The Stylist Store, from who they are (location) to what they buy, how often, how much they spend, and how they respond to discounts and promotions.

 

Data Source: The dataset was sourced directly from The Stylist Store’s internal sales and customer interaction records. It includes comprehensive transactional data, customer demographics, and shopping behaviors that provide a snapshot of how customers engage with the store across various product categories, seasons, and purchasing channels.

 

DATA COLLECTION PROCESS

The data was collected automatically through The Stylist Store’s Point of Sale (POS) system, e-commerce platform, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools. Each time a transaction occurred, whether in-store or online, the system captured key information such as product details, purchase amount, customer demographics, shipping choices, and applied promotions. Additional data such as customer feedback ratings and purchase frequency were recorded through post-purchase interactions and loyalty program activity. This process ensured real-time, consistent, and structured data collection across all store locations.

 

DATA STRUCTURE

File format is CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

This dataset contains 3902 rows and 19 columns.

It is well structured for easy analysis and visualizations. 

 

Data Limitations or Biases: Although the dataset is sourced from The Stylist Store’s internal records and provides strong insights into customer behavior, it still contains slight biases. For instance, it only captures completed transactions, meaning it doesn’t reflect customers who browsed without purchasing, an important group for understanding potential lost sales. Additionally, the data may lean more toward frequent shoppers, which could skew patterns and hide the preferences of new or infrequent customers.

 

STEPS TAKEN TO CLEAN THE DATA

To prepare the dataset for analysis, I carried out several data cleaning and formatting steps in Excel to ensure clarity and consistency.

I removed duplicate values to ensure each customer record was unique.

I eliminated null and blank values to prevent gaps in the analysis.

I adjusted column widths for better readability across the dataset.

I used bold formatting on column headers to highlight key data labels.

I applied borders around the dataset to clearly separate rows and columns.

I used Freeze Panes to keep the top row visible while scrolling.

I applied appropriate data types to numerical columns like purchase amounts and ratings.

I created a standard Excel table to structure and manage the data efficiently.

I applied conditional formatting with data bars to visually emphasize patterns in purchases and ratings.

I chose a clean font and consistent colors to make the dataset easier to work with.

NOTABLE TRENDS AND PATTERNS FROM DASHBOARD ANALYSIS

KPIs

These are the metrics tied to the store’s performance:

Revenue by Product Category (Top: Clothing - $104,264).

Revenue by Season (Top: Fall - $60,018).

Revenue by Location (Top: Montana - $5,784).

Customer Count by Purchase Frequency (Top: Every 3 months - 584).

Revenue Contribution by Loyalty Tier (Top: 1–10 purchases - 20.41%).

 

Additional metrics and areas for improvements:

Underperforming Product Category (Outerwear generated the least revenue: $18,524).

Least Performing Season (Summer had the lowest sales: $55,777)

Customer Segment with Lowest Sales (Subscribed customers generated only $62,645 in revenue).

Least Preferred Shipping Type (Store Pick-up had the lowest rating: 3.71).

Least Frequent Shopping Interval (Weekly shoppers were the smallest group: 539 customers).

Loyalty Tier with Lowest Revenue Contribution (Customers with 11–20 previous purchases contributed just 19.69%).

 

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS (DATA-DRIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GROWTH)

I recommend prioritizing marketing campaigns, new product launches, and seasonal discounts during Fall season. We should also prepare inventory and staffing in advance to accommodate peak shopping behavior.

Summer is the slowest season. I recommend we run exclusive summer promotions, limited-edition items, or flash sales. We can also use targeted ads to re-engage dormant customers during this off-peak period.

Clothing and Accessories are the top two performing categories. I recommend we continue expanding product lines in these categories. We can also implement upsell/cross-sell strategies by recommending accessories with clothing purchases.

Outwear is the least performing products category. I recommend we review pricing, seasonality, and product style and appeal. We should also consider bundling outerwear with more popular categories or promoting during colder months.

We should identify what is working in the Stylist Store in Montana and implement those strategies to lower-performing locations.

I recommend we enhance the subscription program value. We can rework the subscription offering by adding exclusive benefits like early access, better shipping, or members-only discounts. We should also launch a subscriber reactivation campaign.

I recommend prioritizing and promoting standard shipping as the default option. We should also ensure other shipping methods are well-communicated in terms of value to improve their perception.

Weekly shoppers are the smallest group of customers. I recommend we offer weekly email deals, limited-time coupons, or loyalty points to encourage more frequent shopping. We can also try something different like: Highlight "What's New This Week" in marketing communications.

Customers that purchased 11 to 20 times previously contributed the least to revenue (19.69%). I recommend we analyze this group for drop-off patterns and send personalized re-engagement offers. We can also create incentives like “Buy 2 More, Get a Reward” to move them to higher tiers.

 

These recommendations support The Stylist Store success by:

Enhancing the customer experience.

Driving product and location performance.

Maximizing revenue and loyalty through data-backed decisions.
